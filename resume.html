<p>
  These are all of the resources I made when applying to college! I applied to a total of 30 colleges. Feel free to explore and take inspiration each of them.

            <summary><strong>Words of Advice</strong></summary>
            <p>These are some tips I heard that helped me during the application process. Feel free to listen, or not. It's up to you.</p>
            <p>1. Try to get fee waivers. All 30 of the schools I applied to were free.</p>
            <p>2. Be niche and yourself. No one likes a basic, run of the mill applicant.</p>
            <p>3. If you want to get into a top school and only care about its ranking/prestige, consider applying Early Decision.</p>
            <p>4. Don't limit yourself to a set amount of schools. Apply to as many as you want. You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.</p>
            <p>5. Have fun! Applying to college gets boring and tedious when you aren't obsessed with the process.
